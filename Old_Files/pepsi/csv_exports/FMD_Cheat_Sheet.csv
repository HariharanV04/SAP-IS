,Field Mapping Document (FMD) Cheat Sheet
,
,Instructions:
,"Please follow the instructions below to complete the FMD document.  

*** NOTE: Some fields have drop-down lists or special instuctions.  Refer to column headers comments in the Data Mapping Worksheet for additional help information for the Source, IA, and Target sections."
,
,Summary Worksheet
,This sheet contains the object summary and change log tracking information. Whenever an addition/modification is made to the workbook it can be documented in this worksheet.
,The worksheet is partitioned into three areas:
,"Project/Object Information - Please fill in the Project Name, Object Type, Interface ID, Interface Name, FMD Created By, Source Application & Target Application."
,"Change Log - Can be used to track the history of the changes performed on the FMD; with every modification, a new entry can be added for version history tracking"
,
,General Guidelines for Source & Target Worksheets 
,"The Source and Target Worksheet will be completed by the Technical Team (after ATP).  However, Functional designers should complete if they have the information."
,Please adhere to the following guidelines for each specific file type when entering data into the Source & Target Worksheets:
,"Flat File: include the field functional/technical name, field type (i.e. CHAR, DATE, NUMBER, etc), field length, position of field (i.e. 1-10), required/optional, comments, any translations, mappings (i.e. concatentation of multiple fields), etc. from the source/target systems"
,"BAPI, EDI, IDOC: download the complete hierarchial data structure (i.e. from SAP ECC) and copy/paste into the corresponding source or target worksheet.  Make sure all required information (if applicable) is included such as segment / structure, qualifier, message type, field type, field length, required/optional, etc.     "
,"XML: download or manually enter in the XML Xpath (i.e. similar to a file directory path used in windows explorer) into the corresponding source or target worksheets.  Also include the functional/technical field name, field type (i.e. CHAR, DATE, NUMBER, etc), field length, required/optional, comments, etc."
,
,Source  Worksheet
,"The Source Worksheet can document the necessary information about the source application data such as the data attributes, structure, source data translations/transformations, field formatting, mappings to tables (i.e. staging, target), and file/message layout.   There will be no pre-defined template for this sheet and it will be free-form based since the Source Structure Type will determine the requirements (i.e. Flat File, EDI, IDOC, XML, etc).  

*** NOTE: The Source and Target Worksheets will be used only for reference and will not be auto linked to the Data Mapping Worksheet.  Data Mapping will an independent and separate manual mapping exercise that will need to be completed."
,
,Target Worksheet
,"The Target Worksheet can document the necessary information about the source application data such as the data attributes, structure, target data translations/transformations, field formatting, mappings to tables (i.e. staging, source), and file/message layout.   There will be no pre-defined template for this sheet and it will be free-form based since the Target Structure Type will determine the requirements (i.e. Flat File, EDI, IDOC, XML, etc).  

*** NOTE: The Source and Target Worksheets will be used only for reference and will not be auto linked to the Data Mapping Worksheet.  Data Mapping will an independent and separate manual mapping exercise that will need to be completed."
,
,Data Mapping Worksheet
,"The Data Mapping Worksheet will contain an end to end view of the data mapping between the source, IA, and target applications. It includes any required logic, translation, transformation, formatting, default values, etc. necessary to achieve the input required by the target application. "
,The worksheet is partitioned into three areas:
,Source
,"To facilitate the documentation proceed to fill in this section by starting with the ""Structure Type"" Field.  Once a type is selected, certain columns will become grayed out and will not need to be filled.  Fill in the appropriate data into each column and refer to comments in the column headers if follow up or additional details are documented (i.e action items, questions, clarification, etc.) "
,
,Transformation/Translation
,"This section should be completed as a collaborative effort between the Source, IA, and Target application teams.  This section is divided into four sub-sections:"
,1. Transformation/Translation Type: In this column document the type of transformation that is to be performed on the field.
,"CodeDecode - Select this for Static Cross-Reference Lookups (i.e. Unit of Measure, Payment Method, etc)"
,Default - Select if a default value is required
,"Logic - Select if mapping logic needs to be added (i.e. concatenation of multiple fields, formatting, etc)"
,Pass-thru - Select if field value will be passed directly with no manipulation required
,xRef - Select for Dynamic Cross-Reference Lookups (i.e. Vendor)
,"2a. Default Value / Transformation Logic - If Transformation/Translation Type equals Default, input default value(s).  Or the transformation logic is pre-populated for auto-generated FMD"
,"2b. Transformation Code - If FMD is auto-generated, transformation code is populated."
,3. Validation/Error Handling: Use this column to document any validation/error handling that needs to performed on the data as it is being processed. Depending on the outcome of the validation please indicate the corresponding course of action required.
,"4. Comments: Use this column to provide any additional comments.  Also if the transformation/translation type is CodeDecode or xRef, the name of the specific lookup is required.  Please refer to the P1UP Cross Reference Requirements Document by clicking on the following object link to the document in StarTeam:  "
,
,Target

,
,FMD Issue Tracking
,This worksheet will track any issues that need to be resolved AFTER the FMD has been approved (ATP).  This worksheet is not intended to track any action items or issues during the FMD completion process.
,
,Translation Tables
,This worksheet will have all translation tables
,
,Additional Comments
,"*** NOTE: Conversion and Interface functional designs should have a one-to-one relationship with the SAP data type but there can be multiple Field Mapping Documents (FMDs) per functional design.  For example, if there are 15 source systems for an inbound invoice interface to SAP ECC, then there should be 15 FMDs (one for each source system to target system)."
